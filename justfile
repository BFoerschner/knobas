# The cargo recipes drop RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN so rust-toolchain.toml is what
# decides the toolchain. An inherited RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN would silently
# override the pin and let the gate pass on an unpinned compiler.

# `front` runs before the cargo recipes because it is the fast half: a
# svelte-check error or a broken `vite build` is reported in seconds instead of
# after a full workspace compile. It is *not* a build dependency of the cargo
# recipes -- `tauri::generate_context!` only reads `frontendDist` when the
# `custom-protocol` feature is on (production, i.e. `tauri build`); a dev build
# with `devUrl` set takes the empty default asset set and never looks at
# `app/dist`. Nothing here may create that directory either: a missing one is
# exactly how `tauri build` refuses to bundle an app with no frontend in it.

# The same lint pass over the libraries alone -- which is the only way to see
# them the way something that merely *depends* on them does.
#
# `--all-targets` pulls in every crate's dev-dependencies, and cargo unifies
# features across the whole invocation. `knobas-db` dev-depends on itself with
# `test-util` on, so that one dev-dependency silently turns the feature on for
# the library build too, and the lib gets linted in a configuration nothing
# ships. Items whose only callers are behind `test-util` then look live, and
# their dead-code warnings surface only later -- in `tauri dev`, or for any
# consumer building `knobas-db` without the feature.
#
# Dropping `--all-targets` for `--lib` drops the dev-dependencies with it, so
# each library is checked with the features a consumer actually gets. Almost
# free after the pass above: same crates, same profile, a subset of the units.

# Install app/ dependencies if they are missing or older than the lockfile.

# `npm ci` deletes and reinstalls node_modules wholesale: right on a fresh
# clone or after the lockfile moves, pure waste on every other run. Staleness
# is a timestamp comparison, not a content one -- npm's hidden
# `node_modules/.package-lock.json` is its own flattened view of the tree and is
# never byte-equal to `package-lock.json`, so comparing the two files would
# reinstall every single time. npm rewrites the hidden file on install, so
# "lockfile is newer" means exactly "installed against an older lockfile",
# including after a pull or a branch switch.
