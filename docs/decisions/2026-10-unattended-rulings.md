# Unattended rulings — from 2026-10-11, Opus as deputy

The `/v15-next` loop now runs over every `ready-for-agent` issue, not one milestone, and its deputy is Opus. The shape is the 2026-08-29 batch's (`2026-08-29-unattended-batch-rulings.md`) and the v1.5 milestone's (`2026-09-v1-5-unattended-rulings.md`): each ruling is posted as a comment on its issue, beginning `Ruling (deputy for Björn, <date>):`, and the PR that acts on it appends the same four parts here, in the order ruled. The deputy first looks for an answer that already exists — the ticket, its spec, `CONTEXT.md`, the ADRs, the decision records — and quotes it; only an open fork gets a new ruling. Björn reverses one with a follow-up ticket, and a ruling that settles something architectural gets its ADR through the implementer, per this directory's README.

## #593 — `repo` directly before `pr`, or directly after it

Ruled 2026-10-11. Comment:
<https://github.com/BFoerschner/knobas/issues/593#issuecomment-6113041302>

**The fork:** #593 says "`repo` moves to directly after `pr`, ahead of `branch` and `commit`". The
same ticket also says "**a parent kind always comes before its child kinds**". A PR sits in a repo,
so the literal sentence breaks the rule for the repo→PR pair. PR #602 follows the rule and puts
`repo` directly *before* `pr`: `ticket, asset, repo, pr, build_config, build, page, note, commit,
branch, route, monitor`. Should `repo` go where the sentence says, or where the rule says?

**Ruling:** follow the rule. `repo` goes directly before `pr`, as PR #602 has it. This was already
decided, and the ruling only confirms it.

**Reasoning:** the answer is written down in three places, and all three agree:

- ADR-0018 (accepted): "a commit, branch or PR sits in a repo … In the fixed group order, a parent
  kind always comes before its child kinds."
- `CONTEXT.md`, **Parent**: "The entity you can open that an item sits directly inside: a repo for
  a branch, PR or commit; …"
- #591, user story 12: "As a developer, I want the repo group to come before the branch, PR and
  commit groups, so that the thing I navigate *to* is above the things I scroll *through*."

Story 12 names the PR group outright. "Directly after `pr`" is a slip in wording: #591's
Implementation Decisions has the same slip, and #593 copied it from there. The same bullet in #591
opens with the governing rule, and the ADR states that rule as a consequence of the decision. The
sentence describes one move, taking `repo` out of last place and putting it above the kinds that
sit in it, and one slot before `pr` does that. The ticket's scope and its five acceptance criteria
are unchanged, and #602 meets the first criterion's stricter reading too (repo above PR as well as
above branch and commit). `GROUP_ORDER` is not a §10.8 frozen surface (`docs/contract.md` does not
mention group order). Both of #602's tests are witnessed: mutant M2, the ticket's literal wording,
fails the unit rule test and the real-PostgreSQL `Searcher` test.

No glossary entry or ADR changes. The only text that disagrees is the bullet in spec #591; if
Björn wants the record clean, that bullet becomes "`repo` moves to directly before `pr`". That is
an edit to the spec issue and does not block #602.

**If you disagree, the cost of reversing this is:** trivial in the code: swap two entries in
`GROUP_ORDER` and drop the `("repo", "pr")` pair from the `PARENT_KINDS` test table. But the result
would contradict ADR-0018 and story 12, so a reversal means amending ADR-0018 (for example, "a
parent kind comes before its child kinds, except that a PR may precede its repo") and rewriting
story 12. It cannot be done in a comment.

## #592 — a route's URL: its body, or part of its name

Ruled 2026-10-11. Comment:
<https://github.com/BFoerschner/knobas/issues/592#issuecomment-6113047688>

**The fork:** migration `0018` weights a route's name and its URL both at A, so a route named `kuma` and a route that only carries `kuma` in its URL tie, and recency decides. The implementer gave three options. (A) Add a migration in this PR that moves the URL to a lower weight, with a §10.8 entry. (B) Rule that a route has no body, keep `0018` as it is, and record the ruling. (C) Open the PR tests-only and file a follow-up ticket for routes. The implementer leans to (B).

**Ruling:** (A). The URL is a route's body. This PR adds the next free migration (`0026` as of `main` at `e628b9db`; take the number when the entry is written, as the §10.8 entries do) and changes nothing in it except `knobas.route.fts`: name at A, URL at B, the same `alter column fts set expression` shape `0019` used on `knobas.asset`. In the same PR:
- a §10.8 entry for the migration, ratified under this issue's "What to build" and flagged for Björn's review, in the shape of the `0025` entry;
- route added to the ranking witness on the `Searcher` against real PostgreSQL: a route named for the token ranks above a route whose URL alone carries it;
- the **Not routes** paragraph in `tests/it/ranking.rs` rewritten, since this ruling answers the question it leaves open.

`0018` is never edited. `corpus.rs`'s **Not fixed here** paragraph covers lexing (which parts of a URL become lexemes), not weight, so it stays. No glossary change and no ADR.

**Reasoning:** the answer already exists, so this ruling applies it and does not re-decide anything.

- Issue #592, "What to build": *"Every kind ranks a match in an item's title above a match only in its body."* Spec #591, Implementation Decisions: *"the full-text corpus weights the title above the body for every kind"*, and story 25: *"so that the thing *named* what I typed comes first in every kind."* `CONTEXT.md` line 12 lists route as a kind.
- `CONTEXT.md`, **Route**: *"_Avoid_: URL (that is a route's property)"*. The glossary has already ruled that a URL is not how a route is named. `knobas_search::corpus::ROUTE` agrees: `title: "r.name"`, and `headline_text: "r.name || ' — ' || r.url"` is a title followed by its body. `0019` set the estate's rule for a property: *"A name match (A) outranks an ancestor match (B) outranks a property match (C)"*. A route stores no path in its `fts` (`0018`: *"No `path_text` here"*), so B is the next rung below the name. C would also meet the ticket. B is preferred because a route has no other text to sit between its name and its URL, and B matches the body weight in `0001` for items and notes.
- Option (B)'s premise doesn't hold. Weight decides rank, not whether a route matches. `sql.rs` matches with `{fts} @@ q.tsq` and ranks with `ts_rank_cd(..., q.tsq)`, so a lexeme at B is found exactly as one at A. `8111` still finds its route, and `0018`'s *"so 'kuma' and '8111' find the routes that carry them"* stays true word for word. The only thing A buys the URL is the tie this ticket exists to break.
- Option (A)'s premise ("needs Björn's sign-off") is also wrong as written. Since 2026-08-29, migration additions are ratified by the orchestrator under the ticket's own criterion and merged by the merge-manager: *"let Migration and ipc additions be merged by fable too"* (§10.8, the #42 entry). Each entry is flagged for Björn's review. The `0025` entry is the precedent for a deputy ruling taking a migration in Björn's absence: *"ratified in his absence by the deputy's ruling of 2026-09-08 on #506"*. `corpus.rs` says widening `0018`'s `fts` *"belongs to a ticket that says so"*. This ticket says "every kind", so it is that ticket.
- (C) would close #592 with one kind not doing what the issue says, and the follow-up would carry the same migration and the same entry. The ticket's scope stays unchanged, and the frozen surface grows by one generated-column expression on the smallest table knobas has (`0019`: *"a fraction of a second"*). The witness is the `Searcher` against real PostgreSQL (ADR-0013).

**If you disagree, the cost of reversing this is:** low. One more migration sets `knobas.route.fts` back to name and URL both at A, plus a §10.8 entry. The route case comes out of the ranking test, and the ruling (B) would have written goes into `docs/decisions/`. No IPC, descriptor, adapter or stored data changes in either direction, because a generated column is recomputed from `name` and `url` on every rewrite.
